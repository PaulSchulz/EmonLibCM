#EmonLibCM

The EmonLibCM library is maintained by @Robert.Wall and mirrored here for users of github.

See forum release: [EmonLibCM - Version 2](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/emonlibcm-version-2/9241)

This Continuous Monitoring library provides a means of using advanced features of the Atmel ATMega328P microprocessor to give a way to measure voltage, current and power on a single-phase electricity supply. The physical quantities are measured continuously, the average values are calculated and made available to the host sketch at user-defined intervals.

The library incorporates temperature monitoring using the DS18B20 sensor and pulse counting.

This document has the following main sections:

- Key Properties – important points about this library
- Using EmonLibCM – a very brief explanation of how to use this library
- Application interface – power and energy (including pulse counting)
- Application interface – temperature monitoring
- List of required supporting libraries
- Initial configuration
- Calibration notes
- Example Sketches
- Alphabetical index of Application Interface functions
